+ Technology drives strong sales growth but some items (e.g., 3D Printers, Laser Printers) cause large losses → phase out or renegotiate with suppliers to cut negative impact.

+ Return rates are highest in Tables and Appliances (>7%) → improve product quality checks and after-sales support to reduce return costs.

+ The US generates the highest profit, while many other regions contribute marginally → prioritize the US for core investment while exploring growth in mid-tier markets like China and India.

+ West and EMEA have the highest return rates (11.7% and 10%) → strengthen quality control and review product-market fit in these areas.

+ Sales show steady growth across markets, with the US and EMEA leading → allocate more resources to sustain momentum and capture market share.

+ Profit margin is high in Caribbean and Central Asia despite lower sales → expand targeted campaigns to maximize profitability in these niche markets.


**6. FINAL CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS** 

The company is experiencing strong growth with Consumer segment and US market as the main drivers of revenue and profit. However, some regions such as EMEA and West face high return rates and weaker margins, signaling a need for better product adaptation and quality control. At the same time, emerging regions like Central Asia and the Caribbean, though smaller in sales, show high profitability and potential for expansion. In addition, a few key customers contribute significantly to profit, emphasizing the importance of customer relationship management.

Recommendations:

+ Consolidate presence in high-performing segments (Consumer) and markets (US) to strengthen market share.

+ Improve product quality and localization in underperforming regions to reduce return rates and boost margins.

+ Allocate resources to grow niche but profitable markets (Central Asia, Caribbean) for long-term expansion.

+ Develop loyalty and retention programs for top customers to secure stable and sustainable revenue streams.
